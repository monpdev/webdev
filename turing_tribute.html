    <h3 id="headline">The timeline of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London, United Kingdom</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1922</strong> - Attended Hazelhurst Preparatory School in Sussex.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1926</strong> - Went to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in Sherborne, Dorset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1931</strong> - Studied at King's College,Cambridge. He was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1936</strong> - Published a paper titled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Enscheidungsproblem." The formulation in this paper became the basis of hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1936</strong> - Studied under Alonzo Church at Princeton University.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1938</strong> - Received a Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Priceton University. His dessertation was titled "Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals"
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1938</strong> - Returned to Cambridge, United Kingdom and worked as a lecturer at University of Cambridge. He also started working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School, the British codebreaking organization. He became the leading figure in breaking the German encryptions at the Bletchley Park during the World War II
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946</strong> - Was appointed Officer of the Order of the British by King George VI for his war time services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946</strong> - Wrote a paper describing the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1948</strong> - Was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. Later he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory. Heproposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". 
      </li>
      <li><strong>1952</strong> - Published another masterpiece on "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis." His work on mathematical biology remains relevant until today</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1954</strong> - Died at the age of 41.  The cause of death was cyanide poisoning by suicide
      </li>

        "From a very young age, I knew about the legend of Alan Turing – among awkward, nerdy teenagers, he is a patron saint. He never fit in, but accomplished these wonderful things, as part of a secret queer history of computer science.
And so I always dreamt of writing something about him, and I thought that there had never been a proper narrative treatment of his life, that he deserved."
